# rock-paper-scissors
 A basic rock, paper, scissors game.

 This code creates a basic rock-paper-scissors game. It includes HTML elements for displaying the game result, a message, and counts for wins, losses, and draws. The game logic is implemented in the playRound function, which takes the player's choice and the computer's choice as input, compares them, and determines the result. The game function is called when a player selects a choice, and it calls playRound with the player's choice and a randomly generated computer choice. There is also a "New Game" button that reloads the page when clicked.
